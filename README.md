## Lessons Learned
This project really helped me learn how to use the JPARepositories. The JPARepositorie helped a lot because it allows you to use the methods that they already have, which helps cut down on the typing and allows me to focus on the more complicated methods that I have to make. This project is much simpilier than a lot of my other programs but with the simplicity it helped me focus a lot more on the controller. This project really helped me understand how to use the controller, path variable and the various types of mapping.
